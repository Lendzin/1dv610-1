## Goals

Assignment 4. Working with requirements and tests
 * Terms: Individual assignment, no code may be copied from other students or any other source. 
 * Starts: When the assignment is published on the course web.
 * Deadline: See deadlines
 * Examination: Automatic assessment of completed requirements and manual examination
 * Feedback: Help is given during tutoring time and slack. Students will receive feedback by email from the examiner when all handins have examined.

After completing the assignment the student should have...
 * ...done a second iteration on a system
 * ...had the chance to focus on code quality 
 
## Rules

Examiner sets the degree using the following:
 * Requirement fulfillment
 * Quality of handin.

### The set of minimum requirements for getting a grade (may still be F)
* Solution has been submitted before the deadline
* Code should be available on a public git repository. 
* The application must be deployed on a public web server, the server must be available to the examiner for the rest of the course.
* The assignment is done individually! You are not allowed to copy or take solutions from others.
* No code is copied from others, student has worked alone
* No external code except the code given in task, no libraries are used
* HTML follows [web standards](https://validator.w3.org/)
* Application can be tested with the automated test application.
* Code has one single page (index.php) Its ok to have another page for testing 
* The application is written in PHP.
* No javascript is used

### Examination criteria 1. Requirement fulfillment (25% of grade)
* The more testcases that are fullfilled, the better
  * 50%->59% Grade E
  * 60%->69% Grade D
  * 70%->84% Grade C
  * 85%->95% Grade B
  * 95%->100% Grade A
* Test-cases should be manually and automatically testable (using the test application).
* The application is well tested even outside of the explicit tests
* Application works as the example implementation

### Examination criteria 2. Additional Requirement(s) (25% of grade)
* Student should add some functionality to the application. Preferably with a logged in and a logged out use-case.
* This additional requirement is graded by adding a score to each of the following.
  * Size & Complexity of the added requirement(s), 2-3 Extra Use-cases
  * Usability (How useful is the requirement in current state)
  * Presentation (How well are the extra use-cases and testing-effort presented on GitHub)
 * Each of these three criterias will get a grade between 0-4

### Examination criteria 3. Code and Solution Quality (50% of grade)
The examininer will do a subjective code review on the entire git-repository and judge the code on the following.

#### Sub-Criteria: Code is Object Oriented. (as discussed on lectures, previous courses, and course literature)
 * Code in classes
 * Classes have dependencies
 * Avoids using an array when something should be a class
 * Code uses type-safety when possible
 * Dependencies are encapsulated in a single class 
 * Databases, files, super-global arrays($_GET, $_SESSION...) etc
 * No string dependencies (especially avoid on superglobal arrays)
 * Code has an architecture eg. MVC
 * Low coupling
 * Information Expert
 * Law of Demeter

#### Sub-Criteria: Code is Clean. (as discussed on lectures and course literature)
 * Self explanatory code and well commented
 * Code is readable, no commented out code, indentation on GitHub looks good
 * Meaningful names
 * Errors are handled well (Validation, Exceptions)
 * High and low abstraction levels are separated
 * Read like a newspaper
 * Little code duplication

#### Sub-Criteria: Project is represented well (For example on GitHub)
 * Status: What is implemented, or not?
 * Describe how to test?
 * Describe how to install?
 * No passwords in git!
 * There is a git history
 * Code is readable, no commented out code, indentation on GitHub looks good
 
#### Sub-Criteria: General impression
 * Examiners overall impression.
 
Each sub-criteria (1-4) is given a grade 0-4 on the following scale:
* 0\. Not even an attempt
* 1\. Fail
* 2\. Sufficient (bare minimum)
* 3\. Good (Some qualities)
* 4\. Excellent (All is good)

Grade on criteria 2 is set by the following
 * A. All 4s
 * B. All 3s, or better
 * C. All 3s
 * D. All 2s, or better
 * E. All 2s
 * F. Some 0 or 1

## Requirements, example application, and test-cases.

The Login/Registration requirements and test-applications for L3 are exactly the same as in L2.

## Assignment submission

 * Commit and push a release to GitHub
 * Upload latest version on public server
 * Run the automated test against your 
 * Fill in the submission form here: (Will be given later...)
