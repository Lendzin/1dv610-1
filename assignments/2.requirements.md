* The application must be deployed on a public web server, the server must be available to the examiner for the rest of the course.
* The Assignment is done individually! You are not allowed to copy or take solutions from others.
* No code is copied from others, student has worked alone
* No external code except the code given in task, no libraries are used
* No javascript is used
* HTML follows [web standards](https://validator.w3.org/)

* The application is written in PHP.

###Requirement fulfillment
 * All mandatory test-cases MUST be successful 
 * The more testcases that are fullfilled, the better
 * Test-cases should be manually and automatically testable (using the test application).
